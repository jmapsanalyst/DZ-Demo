#Irish DZ-Demo
##An initial demo of Decarbonisation Zones of Ireland, a work in progress. 
Boundaries, be it county, electoral divisions or small census areas were pulled together from a variety of publicly available sources, primarily reports from individual Irish County Council websites. 
Some boundaries conform to small census areas while others have arbitrary delimitations. 
In this case image/raster files have been geolocated to as accurate as possible considering the quality of the images within County Council reports. 
As of yet no .shp or geopackages of DZ boundaries have been provided by CC’s.
