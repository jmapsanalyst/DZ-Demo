# DZ-Demo
An initial demo of DZ zones of Ireland, a work in progress.
DZ boundaries pulled together from a variety of publically available sources, primarily County Council websites. 
Some boundaries conform to small census areas while others have arbtrary deliminations. 
In this case image/raster files have been geolocated to as accuarte as possibe considering the the quality of the images within County Council reports.
No .shp or geopackages available as of yet.
